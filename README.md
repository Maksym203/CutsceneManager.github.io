## Introduction

Cutscenes are usually the first thing we see when we start a game as it's the best and easiest way to introduce the player into the game and it's story. They can also help with some transitions and they are an essential part when it comes to making a videogame come together, sometimes making it feel almost like a movie if well applied.
