# CutsceneManager
## Introduction

Cutscenes are non-interactive sequences which usually are the first thing we see when we start a game as it's the best and easiest way to introduce the player into the game and it's story. They can also help with some transitions and they are an essential part when it comes to making a videogame come together, sometimes making it feel almost like a movie if well applied. 

The main three types of cutscenes are these: In-Engine, Pre-Rendered and Live-Action.

* In-Engine: These are the easiest and cheapest cutscenes to make, as you will be using already-made-assets from the game. But at the same time, they can be the most problematic, since all assets and characters should have high resolution and it would require some extensive coding.

* Pre-Rendered: Pre-Rendered cutscenes are the highest quality cutscenes, nearly like a cinematic. They are usually made by animation companies external to the videogame company itself and take so much time to make that only a few can be made during the whole production of the videogame.

* Live-Action: Live-Action cutscenes use real actors and green screens to film them and then digitalize them and add special effects later, making them much cheaper thatn the Pre-Rendered ones and also much more viable time-wise.

## History

Cutscenes in videogames were almost born at the same time as the videogames themselves, though they didn't start exactly the same as we know them today.

The first ever cutscene introduced into a game, was in 1966, in The Sumerian Game which was an early mainframe game. It wasn't exactly a in-game cutscene, as they used a slideshow with some syncronized audio, making a cutscene that was unskippable.

Later in 1979, in Space Invaders Part 2, there wwere introduced some short cutscenes about intermissions between levels. Pac-Man (1980) also did the same thing.

It wasn't until 1983, that a similar cutscene  to the ones we know today was introduced in Bega's Battle. It introduced some full-motion video cutscenes between shooting stages, which was normalized years later.

Finally, non-interactive plot sequences were added in Maniac Mansion (1987), introducing a whole new concept to videogames which ended up being followed by all future games until today.

Also, with the creation of CD-ROMs as the new storage for videogames, all the videogames developers were able to start making much higher quality games.
